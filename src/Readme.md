# 🎲 Tenzies Game (React Capstone Project)

## 🎮 About the Game

> **Tenzies** is a dice game where the player tries to get all 10 dice to show the same number. You can "hold" dice to freeze their values while rolling the rest. The game ends when all dice are held and show the same number.

## 💡 Personal Reflection

This was a truly **challenging**, yet incredibly **fun** project. It tested my understanding of hooks, state logic, and UI interactivity — but Bob Ziroll was there every step of the way in the course, guiding me through the process with clear, structured lessons.
